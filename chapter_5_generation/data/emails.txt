  Here is our forecast   
  Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.  As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.    My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time. 
  test successful.  way to go!!!
  Randy,   Can you send me a schedule of the salary and level of everyone in the  scheduling group.  Plus your thoughts on any changes that need to be made.   (Patti S for example)  Phillip
  Let's shoot for Tuesday at 11:45.  
  Greg,   How about either next Tuesday or Thursday?  Phillip

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;  the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,  on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic  consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time  consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the  inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the  consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can  arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to  happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the  consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude  building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the  future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm  requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project  plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.  The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to  themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this  project.  I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been  good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now  we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

We've had  three meetings which brought out very different issues from different  traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader  requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements. We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to  be outside the scope of position consolidation.  Things left to do: I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to  make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this  project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope. Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this  project and which fall out of scope. For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and  work with traders to define the exact requirements of each. Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all  drill downs. Use the above to formulate a project plan.  Things requested thus far (no particular order): Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal  ticker. Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that  add up existing position manager rows/columns). New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical,  transport, swaps, options, ... Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values  of all curves on which the desk has a position. Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be  shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid  would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid. Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the  appropriate positions to show for each: Gas Daily for monthly index, Physical gas for Nymex, Physical gas for Inside Ferc, Physical gas for Mid market. Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of  using official valuations. Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks. Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS: Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility  skew and correlations. Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.   Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a  gamma grid. Valuation of Gas Daily options. A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD. Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets. Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position  manager. Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms,  prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change. Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker. Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of  individual deals on the position total in a grid cell. Benchmark positions in TDS. Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit  and explicit position break out issues.  -- Allan.  PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for  transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that  point.

Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package on San Marcos that you received earlier. If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know. Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?  San Marcos The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.  Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now.  If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will know more on this question later today.  Sincerely,  George W.

  ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/28/2000  01:09 PM ---------------------------     	 	 	From:  Phillip K Allen                           09/28/2000 10:56 AM 	   Liane,   As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to  manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single  buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above  market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades,  offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were  bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index  calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated  financial swaps for San Juan.   We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage  firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:   1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.    2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &  Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and         October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that  are dramatically different.    I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the  trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to  determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are  outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in  establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at  $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the  calculation of index.   It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to  conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me  anytime I can assist you towards this goal.  Sincerely,  Phillip Allen

Crocker"  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.  REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based reporting.  BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?"  Please expand.

  ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000  04:26 PM ---------------------------   "George Richards" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 PM Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> To: "Phillip Allen" <pallen@enron.com> cc: "Larry Lewter" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, "Claudia L. Crocker"  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

  Reagan,  Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.  Phillip

Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding  as far as I can determine.?

If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is  no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.?  ? I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and  find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can. ? I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable  document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.?  This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last  night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said  this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.?  ? I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at  that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even  needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any  need to contact me regarding the  closing. ? I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself  and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't  seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my  signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it  reviewed before I accept it. ? Brenda ? ?

  Greg,  Happy B-day. Email me your phone # and I will call you.  Keith
  Kathy,  Regarding the guest password for gas daily, can you please relay the  information to Mike Grigsby at 37031 so he can pass it along to the user at  gas daily today.  I will be out of the office on Friday.  thank you  Phillip
  John,   Denver's short rockies position  beyond 2002 is created by their Trailblazer  transport.  They are unhedged 15,000/d in 2003 and 25,000/d in 2004 and  2005.     They are scrubbing all their books and booking the Hubert deal on Wednesday  and Thursday.  Phillip
  Jim,  Is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about all the regulatory issues facing California this week?  Can you make sure the gas desk is included.  Phillip
  George,   Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate  project:   Ownership Structure   What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?   What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what  capacity(regarding ownership and   liabilities)?   Who owns the land? improvements?   Who holds the various loans?   Is the land collateral?   Investment    What happens to initial investment?   Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?    Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?   When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment  schedule?   Investment Return   Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?   Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits  are distributed?   Debt   Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral  is associated with each   loan?   Improvement   Construction   Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.   Terms of each loan?   Uses of Funds   How will disbursements be made?  By whom?   What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing  for investors?   Reports to track expenses vs plan?   Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?   What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get  paid a markup on subcontractors as a   general contractor and paid gain out of profits?   Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses  before the ultimate payout of profits?   Design and Construction    When will design be complete?   What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?   What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction  planning and permitting?   Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors,  vendors, and other professionals?   Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?   Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to  use? Names?  These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor  in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as much as possible from the process.  Phillip                        
  ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/19/2000  04:35 PM ---------------------------   "George Richards" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AM Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> To: "Phillip Allen" <pallen@enron.com> cc: "Larry Lewter" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>  Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls   Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious.  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. George W. Richards Creekside Builders, LLC    - Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls 
  George,   Here sales numbers from Reagan:        As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The  1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the  units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units  under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with  competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals  actually done to date.      Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call  about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was  rejected on the De Ville property.  Phillip Allen           
  Jeff,   What is up with Burnet?  Phillip
  Jeff,   I need to see the site plan for Burnet.  Remember I must get written  approval from Brenda Key Stone before I can sell this property and she has  concerns about the way the property will be subdivided.    I would also like  to review the closing statements as soon as possible.  Phillip
  Lucy,  I want to have an accurate rent roll as soon as possible. I faxed you a copy  of this file.  You can fill in on the computer or just write in the correct  amounts and I will input. 
  Brenda,   I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on  August 28th.  I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845.  I  will go ahead and mail you another check.  If the first one shows up you can  treat the 2nd as payment for October.   I know your concerns about the site plan.  I will not proceed without  getting the details and getting your approval.   I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.  Phillip
  Lucy,   You wrote fewer checks this month.  Spent more money on Materials and less on  Labor.      June  July  August  Total Materials  2929  4085  4801  Services  53  581  464  Labor   3187  3428  2770       Here are my questions on the August bank statement (attached):  1.  Check 1406  Walmart    Description and unit?  2.  Check 1410  Crumps     Detail description and unit?  3.  Check 1411  Lucy      What is this?  4.  Check 1415  Papes      Detail description and units?  5.  Checks 1416, 1417, and 1425  Why overtime?  6.  Check 1428    Ralph's   What unit?  7.  Check 1438    Walmart?    Description and unit?     Try and pull together the support for these items and get back to me.  Phillip

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious.  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. George W.

  Jeff,   I received the rent roll.  I am going to be in San Marcos this weekend but I  am booked with stage coach.  I will drive by Friday evening.  I will let you know next week if I need to see the inside.  Can you find out  when Chelsea Villa last changed hands and for what price?   What about getting a look at the site plans for the Burnet deal.  Remember  we have to get Brenda happy.  Phillip
    9/8  9/7  diff  Socal  36,600  37,200  -600  NWPL  -51,000  -51,250  250  San Juan -32,500  -32,000  -500   The reason the benchmark report shows net selling San Juan is that the  transport positions were rolled in on 9/8.  This added 800 shorts to San Juan  and 200 longs to Socal.  Before this adjustment we bought 300 San Juan and  sold 800 Socal.  
  why is aeco basis so low on the list?  Is NWPL mapped differently than AECO?   What about the correlation to Nymex on AECO?
  Jeff,   You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood.     I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which   I might become involved with Creekside.  Are you in the business of brokering  properties or contacts?  Is your position based on a legal or what you  perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a  project from scratch?   I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.    Phillip

We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly. Sincerely, George W. Richards Creekside Builders, LLC

  Larry,   Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development  opportunities.   I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were  built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for   around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated  that he had more units under construction that would be   available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different  from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor  plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.     As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.     Call or email with your thoughts.  Phillip

Obviously, Seattle, Porltand,  Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude  awakening in the next 2-3 years. ---------------------- Forwarded by Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000  03:41 PM ---------------------------     	Enron North America Corp.

The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and  computer servers for the                   region's growing number of dot-coms.                          Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up  construction                   on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than  a mile from its                   original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several  fiber optic backbones, the                   Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and  eventually                   house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,  Microsoft and Onvia.com.                          Exodus is not the only company building massive data  centers near Seattle.                   More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,  Globix and                   HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house  the networking                   equipment of the Internet economy.                          It is a big business that could have an effect on  everything from your                   monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access  your favorite Web sites.                         Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and  server farms, are                   sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent  Valley that some                   have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and  Puget Sound                   Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,  high-security                   facilities.                          "We are talking to about half a dozen customers that  are requesting 445                   megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"  said Karl                   Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound  Energy. "That is                   the equivalent of six oil refineries."                          A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,  the rise of the Internet                   data center has some utility veterans scratching their  heads.                          Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington  Utilities and                   Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new  data centers. The                   tariff is designed to protect the company's existing  residential and business                   customers from footing the bill for the new base stations  necessary to support                   the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20  million each,                   Karzmar said.                          Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to  bring up the data center                   issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                          For the utilities that provide power to homes,  businesses and schools in the                   region, this is a new and complex issue.                          On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing  appetite for power --                   represent potentially lucrative business customers. The  facilities run 24 hours a                   day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a  constant revenue                   stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that  they could                   potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital  expenditures.                          Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will  mean for power rates                   in the area is still open to debate.                          "These facilities are what we call extremely dense  loads," said Bob Royer,                   director of communications and public affairs at Seattle  City Light.                          "The entire University of Washington, from stadium  lights at the football                   game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.  We have data                   center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40  and 50 megawatts."                          With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate  complex in Tukwila is                   one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased  the 1.35 million                   square-foot Intergate East facility last September from  Boeing Space &                   Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased  92 percent of the                   six-building complex to seven different co-location  companies.                          "It is probably the largest data center park in the  country," boasts Laurent                   Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG  Communications,                   NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama  Networks all                   lease space in the office park.                          After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997,  Sabey has become an                   expert in the arena and now has facilities either under  management or                   development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole  claims his firm is                   one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in  the country.                          As more people access the Internet and conduct  bandwidth-heavy tasks                   such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for  co-location space in                   Seattle continues to escalate.                          But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center  space is growing at a                   rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,  causing similar                   concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and  California.                          Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location  space, plans to nearly                   double the amount of space it has by the end of the year.  While companies                   such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many  high-tech companies                   have decided to outsource the operations to companies such  as Exodus that                   may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic  management.                          "We have 2 million square feet of space under  construction and we plan to                   double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more  demand right now                   than data center space," said Steve Porter, an account  executive at Exodus in                   Seattle.                          The booming market for co-location space has left some  in the local utility                   industry perplexed.                          "It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do  to serve the growth,"                   said Seattle City Light's Royer. "The utility industry is  almost stunned by this, in                   a way."

  Mark,   Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal  basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that  reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints  before and after bidweek.             The following observations can be made:    July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs  actual of .79    2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91    3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.    Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs  actual of .99    2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49    3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the  monthly postings    4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.        Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against  the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any  questions.  Phillip     
  Alan,   You should have received updated numbers from Keith Holst.  Call me if you did not receive them.  Phillip
  Suzanne,   Can you give me more details or email  the plan prior to meeting?  What do I  need to provide besides headcount?  Otherwise any afternoon next week would be fine  Phillip
  Colleen,   Please add Mike Grigsby to the distribution.   On another note, do you have any idea how Patti is holding up?  Phillip
  Brad,   With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial  manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an  associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a  commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to  others in that category at year end.     Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.   Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.   Let me know if there are any issues.  Phillip
  Bruce,  Can you stop by and set up my reuters.  Phillip
  Lucy,   The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add  these modifications:   1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It  should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.   2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.   =e6-g6.   3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width  is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the         letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.   4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to  this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.  Phillip
  Lucy,  I got your email with the attachment.  Let's work together today to get this  done  Phillip
  you have my approval
  Lucy,   We can discuss your email later.  How is progress on creating the  spreadsheets.  You will probably need to close the file before you attach to  an email.  It is 2:00.  I really want to make some progress on these two  files.  Phillip
  Lucy,  Please open this excel file and input the rents and names due for this week.   Then email the file back. 
  Open the "utility" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it  is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1). You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months.  If we  have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper.  Use the rates  described in the spreadsheet.  This is a great chance for you to practice  excel.

Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next week's "Ken Lay Tour" to CA.    He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get these three documents by Monday afternoon?      
  Mac,   Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:    Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year      Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf    Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising.      Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:   (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS  X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share    That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think  crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.   Current price 37  Nat. Gas 34  Crude  10   Total  81     Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this  looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine,  Tosco, and SLB?   Thank you,   Phillip

  I checked into exercising options with Smith Barney, but Enron has some kind  of exclusive with Paine Weber.  I am starting to exercise now, but I am going  to use the proceeds to buy another apartment complex.     What do you think about selling JDSU and buying SDLI?  Also can you look at EOG as a play on rising oil and gas prices.  Thanks,  Phillip

Now that we have had several traders  managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss  any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu  (Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they  will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this  meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is  comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those  who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have  heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to  discuss them.  Please let me know if you are unable to attend.   
  Colleen,   I am out ot the office on Friday, but Keith Holst will attend.  He has been  managing the Transport on the west desk.  Phillip
  Lucy,   Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we  need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.   First, I want to implement the following changes:    1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.   2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily   3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank   4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic  operations.    Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all  the checks since Jan. 1.  When you open the file, go to the "Checkbook" tab and look at the yellow  highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.  Please gather receipts so we can discuss.  Phillip

  can you build something to look at historical prices from where we saved  curves each night.  Here is an example that pulls socal only. Improvements could include a drop down menu to choose any curve and a choice  of index,gd, or our curves.

  ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 07/26/2000  10:44 AM ---------------------------  Michael Etringer  07/26/2000 08:32 AM  To: Keith Holst/HOU/ECT@ect, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Price for Stanfield Term  I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They  have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you  give me a basis for the period :  Sept -00 - May 31, 2006 Sept-00 - May 31, 2008  Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off  Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an  adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread  be on these terms.  Thanks, Mike  
  Wade,   I understood your number one priority was to deal with your vehicle  situation.  You need to take care of it this week.  Lucy can't hold the  tenants to a standard (vehicles must be in running order with valid stickers)  if the staff doesn't live up to it.  If you decide to buy a small truck and  you want to list me as an employer for credit purposes, I will vouch for your  income.  Phillip
  the merlin ct. address is still good.  I don't know why the mailing would be  returned.  
  Tim,  Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.  On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?  Thank you,  Phillip
  Here is the 1st draft of a wish list for systems.

  Gary,  I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.    Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well?  Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.  Phillip Allen

If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS  information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed  as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days  ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to  call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.  With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees  between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to  have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee  data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the  year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC  requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their  profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education  need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is  accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to  hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com  on the command line of your browser.  The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would  like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned  for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please  contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.    Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.      Thanks,   Dave

This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the model.  I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor. The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation very well.  The Enron Research storage model  is a lot like that, although  implementation may be different.    Let me know if you have any questions.  Zimin

  Ray,  Is there any detail on the gas cost proxy.  Which delivery points from which publication will be used?  Basically, can you help us get any clarification on the language "the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California"?  Phillip

  Scott,   I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think  I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from  him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some  price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large  enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.   The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage  the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.  Phillip
  Lucy,   I want to speak to Wade myself.  He can call me at work or home. Or if you  email me his number I will call him.    I would like Gary to direct Wade on renovation tasks and you can give him  work orders for normal maintenance.   I will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office.  Do you need Mary  to come in on any more Fridays?  I think I   can guess your answer.   I might stop by this Friday.  Phillip

The  WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,  which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes  the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but  there can be a siginificant difference between "scheduled" and "actual"  generation.  You are pulling "scheduled."  If someone doesn't schedule their  generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you  will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california  munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,  if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply  schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said  all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on  the generation side.  On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While  they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is  better than the "scheduled" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the  load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.  I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with  others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas  demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,  especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the  UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal  consumer then it is obviously a different story.  Let's talk.

  Ned,  Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.  Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.  I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.  Phillip Allen

  Lucy,   Click on this attachment to see the format to record expenses.  You can keep  a log on paper or on the computer.  The computer would be better for sending  me updates.      What do you think about being open until noon on Saturday.  This might be  more convenient for collecting rent and showing open apartments. We can adjust office hours on another day.  Phillip
  Jeff,   I will respond to the offer on Monday.  There is a $35 Million expansion  adding 250 jobs in Burnet.  I am tempted to hold for $3000/acre.  Owner  financing would still work.   Do you have an opinion?  Phillip
  Al,  I was glad to hear from you.  I hope we can put the past behind us.  Sounds  like you have been busy.  Congratulations on the new baby.  Judging from your  email all is well with you.   That's great.    We did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace).  Three is it for us.   What's your target?  The other two are doing well.  Soccer, T-ball, and bike  riding keeps them busy.  They could use some of Cole's coordination.  My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now.  I am just on  maintenance.  You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical  cyclist.  We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months.   He never misses, rain or shine.  Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial  Park on Saturdays.   Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the  road.  I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday.  I would like to hear more about your new job.  Maybe we could grab lunch  sometime.    Phillip

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be  an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is  O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to  get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and  I'll take care of it..  On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate  curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of  $235,019.    (If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your  overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects  something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal  #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.   139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)   139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)   139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)   231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)   153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)  Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to  GDP-Kingsgate.   Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five  different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for  withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a  Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is  that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport  losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.   I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a  systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems  that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,  the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the  detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it  appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be  an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar  impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in  case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the  volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.    Deal #  251327                  159540                   265229          106300   201756 P&L  $29,503                ($15,960)                ($3,199)           ($2,769)   ($273) Rec:   Ques/Clay Basin/0184   NWPL/Opal 543  NWPL/Opal   Sumas      NWPL/S of  Gr Rvr Del:   NWPL/S of Green River/Clay   Ques/Clay Basin/0852   Ques/Clay  Basin/0852   Ques/Clay Basin    Ques/Clay Basin 1        329       8,738 2     1,500 3         2,974    11,362 4         6,741    12,349       1,439 5       19,052          3,183 9            333 13  30,863       2,680 14  30,451     15  35,226     16         6,979              235  17  17,464      18    9,294      20  10,796          771 21  17,930      22  10,667      23       14,415          9,076 25  23,934       8,695 26     3,284      27         1,976 28     1,751      29     1,591      30  20,242        
  Mary,  If we add both balances together the total is $1,140.  I can spread it over 6  or 12 months.  6 month payout would be $190/month.   12 month payout would be $95/month.  Your choice.  I would like it if you  could work 5/hrs each Friday for another month or so.  Does $10/hr sound  fair?  We can apply it to the loan.  Phillip

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:  Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West  This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

They were polite regarding  asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to  listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to  protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality  agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable  us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder  value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by  reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a  weather product.  As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other  candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy  to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our  opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we  implement our strategy in California.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to  discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to  gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.   Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are  typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?   How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main  contacts at SW Gas?  We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our  control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably  have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the  commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their  commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)  should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month  index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That  risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of  their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.  As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are  there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly  appreciated.  Thanks,  Laird

  Mac,  I checked into executing my options with Smith Barney.  Bad news.  Enron has  an agreement with Paine Webber that is exclusive.  Employees don't have the  choice of where to exercise.  I still would like to get to the premier  service account, but I will have to transfer the money.    Hopefully this will reach you.  Phillip
  Gary,  Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the front porch.    I don't have my floor plan with me at work today, but will bring in tomorrow and fax you a copy.

  Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline.  I am expecting to pay something in the $3,000 to $5,000 range.  I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done.

Use Page Setup under the File menu to change  from Portrait to Landscape if  you want to change from printing vertically  to printing horizontally.  Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want  your print out to be on only one page.  Use Print preview to see what your print out will look like before you print.  The truck might need new sparkplugs at around 120,000-125,000 miles.  A valve  adjustment might do some good.  It has idled very high for the last 25,000 miles, but it has never broken down.

  Frank,  The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.    Phillip

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans  and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is  reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and  Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the  bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double dip" into  the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.   Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term  power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the  bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of  contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very  difficult.  The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8  billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this  concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the  details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward.  Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB  31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill  passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of  Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,  currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be  likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).    According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,  Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated  that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.   Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The  Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,  Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.   Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B    Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B    Bear Stearns  $625 M Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%    Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77% Current Projected  Blended IR:  5.38% Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the  California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these  authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the  governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB  6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid   for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for   the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can   be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this  idea  earlier in the crisis.   SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The  first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the  governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is  August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According  to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has  signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis  and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.    The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond  issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)  stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the  state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and  passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for  bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

  Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.   Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding  the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business  meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is  even desired or necessary.  As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try  and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working  and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet  just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a  round table discussion format.    My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and  jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

  Reagan,  Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include  some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.

Current Notes User:  REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)  1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook  client will be configured on your computer. After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail  via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is  configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is  migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your  web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.  PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and  To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook  client is configured on your desktop.  2. Remote access to your mailbox. After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA)  for remote access to your mailbox.  PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while  connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA  available from your home or when traveling abroad.  HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)  Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:   http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe  Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You  will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user  id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You  will now be able to view your mailbox.     PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between  the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things  in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the  functions NOT available via OWA:  Features NOT available using OWA:  -  Tasks -  Journal -  Spell Checker -  Offline Use -  Printing Templates -  Reminders -  Timed Delivery -  Expiration -  Outlook Rules -  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall -  Sharing Contacts with others -  Task Delegation -  Direct Resource Booking -  Personal Distribution Lists  QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?  If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the  Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:   Outlook.2000@enron.com  Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:   713-853-1411  Thank you,  Outlook 2000 Migration Team

  Tim,  Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our  Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.  On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its  forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been  lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the  second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The  outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some  additional insight?  Thank you,  Phillip
  Gary,  I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general  contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from  the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within  his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe  he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.    Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from  the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you  please email them to me as well?  Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.  Phillip Allen
  Ray,  Is there any detail on the gas cost proxy.  Which delivery points from which  publication will be used?  Basically, can you help us get any clarification  on the language "the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in  California"?  Phillip
  Andrea,  After reviewing Bryan Hull's resume, I think he would be best suited for the trading track program.  Please forward his resume to Karen Buckley.  Phillip
  Ned,  Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for  this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current  summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made  to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal  capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and  withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60  existed at the time of this bid.  Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above  assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.  I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email  with comments.  Phillip Allen

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that  the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large  part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which  the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman  began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or  answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had  some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:  Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce  demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would  export California's problems to the West  This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty  strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner  out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and  if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the  agenda.  Hope this info helps.

  Gary,  Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X  41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story  porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the  front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The  living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the  front porch.    I don't have my floor plan with me at work today, but will bring in tomorrow  and fax you a copy.

  Frank,  The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially  set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever  the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very  short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not  match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.    Phillip

  Johnnie,  Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic  about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels  into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my  budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing  the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.   However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.  I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this  product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you  that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously  consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in  cost over stick built.  Please email your cost estimates when complete.  Thank you,  Phillip Allen

I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.  Please email your cost estimates when complete.  Thank you,  Phillip Allen

  I will try and get my dad to take the appraiser into a couple of units.  Let  me know the day and time.  Phillip
  Larry,  It sounds like Claudia and Jacques are almost finished with the documents.   There is one item of which I was unsure.  Was an environmental report prepared before the original purchase?  If yes, shouldn't it be listed  as an asset of the partnership and your costs be recovered?  Phillip
  Lucy,  The spreadsheet looks fine to me.   Phillip
  Bruce,  Thank you for your bid.  I have decided on a floor plan.  I am going to have  an architect in Austin draw the plans and help me work up a detailed  specification list.  I will send you that detailed plan and spec list when  complete for a final bid.  Probably in early to mid June.  Phillip
  Jeff,  Jacques Craig will draw up a release.  What is the status on the quote from Wade?    Phillip

  ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/10/2001  05:50 PM ---------------------------     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	From:  Stephen Swain                           04/10/2001 11:58 AM 	  To: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Tim Heizenrader/PDX/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Matt  Motley/PDX/ECT@ECT, Michael M Driscoll/PDX/ECT@ECT, Chris  Mallory/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Sean Crandall/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mark Fischer/PDX/ECT@ECT, Bill Williams  III/PDX/ECT@ECT, Diana Scholtes/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: CAISO demand reduction  Phillip et al.,  I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in  the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.  March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand  over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for  temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates  into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as  compared with the previous year.  Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary  reductions (as opposed to "forced" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other  forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making  total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.   This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple  more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6%  decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the  retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it  is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last  year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in  Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation  are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of  meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general  economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least  make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.  Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area  only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC  (U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO  portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in  demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As  you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum  smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at  least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its  wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several  mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are  sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly  how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.   Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's  economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of  the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I  think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already  realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the  non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the  WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around  6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.  I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you  with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I  hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any  questions or need any further information. 
  Lucy,  Here is the rentroll from last friday.    The closing was to be this Thursday but it has been delayed until Friday  April 20th.  If you can stay on until April 20th that would be helpful.  If  you have made other commitments I understand.  Gary is planning to put an A/C in #35.   You can give out my work numer (713) 853-7041  Phillip 
  Thanks for your help.

  Reagan,  I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on  Friday, April 13th.  However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned  I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get  back in touch with you once he is finished.  Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager  from San Antonio.  For my first development project, I feel more comfortable  with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp  Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid  for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am  still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local  relationships.  I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final  determination on unit mix and site plan.  Phillip Allen
  Jacques,  The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit "B" are as follows:  Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225  is outstanding.  Kohutek- $2,150   Cuatro- $37,800   George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this  amount.  The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500  appraisal and $2,375 engineering).    I couldn't find any reference to this  cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.  Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the   sellers to be executed.  Phillip   
  John,  Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter.  Keith  said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity.  I still believe Frank should  receive the same signing incentives as Keith.    Phillip
  Thanks for the response.  I think you are right that engaging an architect is  the next logical step.  I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the  floor plan. He got back to me yesterday with his first draft.  He took my plan and  improved it.  I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.  While  he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification  list.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and  speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on Friday  April 13th.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through  that day?  Also can you provide some references?  Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust  your bid.    Phillip
  Do you have a distribution list to send this to all the traders.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new  building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being  offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.  This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the  new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The  cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is  currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly  employee cost of $94.00.  If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to  the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made  as spaces become available.   The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be  opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street  level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available.  Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an  exit in the event of elevator trouble.   If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to  Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your  email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and  receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new  garage.  The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and  Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.   (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians,  will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

  Jacques  I am out of the office for the rest of the week.  Have you ever seen anyone  miss as much work as I have in the last 6 weeks?  I assure you this is  unusual for me. Hopefully we can sign some documents on Monday.  Call me on my cell phone if  you need me.  Phillip
  Reagan,  I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.  Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?  What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA  221(d) loans?    Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market  quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:    5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment   2%- overhead   4%- profit  I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an  extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even  reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only  generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about  such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down  to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?  I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you  local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of  the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.  Phillip      
  Cary,  Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.  A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:  There will be a double porch across the back just like the front No dormers (Metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs Overall dimensions are 55 by 40   What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry. Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front. That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front porch would be smaller.  I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder. I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan allowed.

  Chad,  Call Ted Bland about the trading track program.  All the desks are trying to use this program to train analysts to be traders.  Your experience should help you in the process and make the risk rotation unnecessary. Unless you are dying to do another rotation is risk.  Phillip 
  no problem
  Reagan,  Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a  list of questions on the specs:  1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less  and cost about the same?  2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory  joist?  3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?  4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What  type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or  Cellulose?  5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?  6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know  the difference between an apron and a stool.  7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent  cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?  8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial  one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.  9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under  the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.  10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount  stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.  11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.  12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?  13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?  14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron  railings?  15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except  for change orders?  I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but  this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to  call Cary Kipp to see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.  Phillip I   
  Larry,  Jacques has sent a document to Claudia for your review.  Just dropping you a  line to confirm that you have seen it.  Phillip
  Jacques,  Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and  architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written  personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the  engineer. I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the  partnership.    I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the  partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been  conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.  Let me know what you think.  Phillip

  Greg,  Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:  Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf  (rentable)  What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?  Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2%  overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.  Why is profit only 4%?   Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.  What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to  boost loan amount but not a real cost?  Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who  receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?  Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?  What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts  NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40%  expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage  would only be 1.16.  Talk to you this afternoon.  Phillip

  John,  Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of  course).  He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period.  His existing  contract pays him a retention payment of $55,000 in the next week.  He still  wants to receive this payment.  Phillip
  Reagan,   Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.   Specific features include:   Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs  Wood stairs  Two story porches on front and rear  Granite counters in kitchens and baths  Tile floors in upstairs baths  Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)  Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths  Solid wood interior doors  Windows fully trimmed  Crown molding in downstairs living areas  2x6 wall on west side   Undecided items include:   Vinyl or Aluminum windows  Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room  Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4  sides      I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.   The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof,  but   only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.     Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a  box with a simple roof   line.  Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.

  How am I to send them the money for the silent second?  Regular mail, overnight, wire transfer?  I don't see how their bank will make the funds available by Friday unless I wire the money.  If that is what I need to do please send wiring instructions.
  Greg,  Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to  replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than  the full replatting process of 3 weeks?  Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the  plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes  across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for  the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.  Phillip
  keith holst sent you an email with the details.
  Jacques,  The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might  object to the language that "the bank that was requested to finance the  construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs  of the construction of the Project".   Technically, that bank lowered the  loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of  equity that would be required.   Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.  Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans,  engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are  in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking  directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on  what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.    The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we  need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and  give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.  Phillip

  Larry,  Jacques has been working with Claudia.  I will check his progress this  morning and let you know.  Phillip
  Greg,  just a note to let you know I will be out of the office Wed(3/21) until  Thurs(3/23).  The kids are on spring break.  I will be in San Marcos and you  can reach me on my cell phone 713-410-4679 or email pallen70@hotmail.com.  I was planning on stopping by to see Hugo Elizondo on Thursday to drop off a  check and give him the green light to file for replatting.  What will change  if we want to try and complete the project in phases.  Does he need to change  what he is going to submit to the city.  I spoke to Gordon Kohutek this morning.  He was contracted to complete the  soils study.  He says he will be done with his report by the end of the  week.  I don't know who needs this report.  I told Gordon you might call to  inquire about what work he performed. His number is 512-930-5832.  We spoke on the phone about most of these issues.  Talk to you later.  Phillip
  Jacques,  Here is Larry Lewter's response to my request for more documentation to  support the $15,000.  As you will read below, it is no longer an issue.

  Jacques,  Still trying to close the loop on the $15,000 of extensions.  Assuming that  it is worked out today or tomorrow, I would like to get whatever documents  need to be completed to convey the partnership done.  I need to work with the engineer  and architect to get things moving.  I am planning on  writing a personal  check to the engineer while I am setting up new accounts.  Let me know if  there is a reason I should not do this.  Thanks for all your help so far.  Between your connections and expertise in  structuring the loan, you saved us from getting into a bad deal.  Phillip
  The topic will the the western natural gas market.  I may have overhead slides.  I will bring handouts.

  Jacques,  I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of  value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to  use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey,  appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in  extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like  earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I  didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear  this up.  Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.   Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and  the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand,  conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was  clean.  What is your inclination?  Call as soon as you have a chance to review.  Phillip

  Lucy,  Here is the rentroll.  My only questions are about #18, #25, and #37 missed rent.  Any special  reasons?  It looks like there are five vacancies #2,12,20a,35,40.  If you want to run  an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine. I will write you a letter of recommendation.  When do you need it?  You can  use me as a reference.  In the next two weeks we should really have a good  idea whether the sale is going through.  Phillip
  I also need to know the base salaries of Jay Reitmeyer and Monique Sanchez.   They are doing the same job as Matt.

According to BPA, it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.  Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back. Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending exchange energy into California, however.  More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter. 
  Thanks for the information.  It would be helpful if you would send the  detailed worksheet that you mentioned.  I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones  granted this January.  I have always elected to defer any distributions of  restricted stock.  I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be  kept in enron stock (50%).   Are you saying that all the previous grants have  fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account?  Thank you for looking into this issue.  Phillip

The  summary  presents the numbers as only $1400 in concessions.   
  Gentlemen,  Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to  date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is  still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot  and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a  topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to  coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the  smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going  to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to  complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which  $14,000 are due now for work completed.    We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by  the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can  continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's  number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and  ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call  and he was fine with that.    Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp  Flores can be used.  Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very  optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.  Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about  moving this project forward.  Phillip

  Jacques,  George finally sent me some information.  Please look over his email.  He  wants us to buy him out.  Keith and I think this is a joke.    We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to  determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect  work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation  for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were  proposing was unsupportable by the market.    My version of a buyout is attached.  I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to  foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?   Since their cost and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I  wouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I  want to respond to their offer asap.  Call me with your thoughts.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about  500+ units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,  this, we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested loan amount to $8,868,000.  I have summarized our issues as follows:  1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:       Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment      Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR      2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475      3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417  2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit turn over.  3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).  4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x  debt coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.  5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.  6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:       Land -                   $1,121,670      Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000      Cash Equity              $1,419,268      Total                    $2,955,938  7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage  of actual hard construction costs.  (See attached file: MAPTTRA.xls)      - MAPTTRA.xls 
  Darrell,  Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his  excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the  land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like  to proceed and develop the property.    My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would  also like to compare construction and development services between what you  can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.   Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to  be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural  work to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is  Quattro Consultants out of Buda.  Let me know if you have an opinion about  either.  I look forward to working with you.  Talk to you tomorrow.  Phillip

  George,  I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million.  The components are as follows:       Unit Cost, Site work, &      builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million       Land                      1.15       Interim Financing               .85       Common Areas                     .80       Total                         $10.4  Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.  Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.  After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.  Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to  discuss alternatives.  Phillip

  Lucy,  Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:  #2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is  not on any rentroll that I can see.  #9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she  will start paying on #9  #15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to  collect the $95 in question.  #33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?  #26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.   Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.  #44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of  the year.  #33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't  see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?  The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to  figure these out immediately.  I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll  in case you need to research these questions.  I will not be in the office next week.  If I can get connected you might be  able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com.  Otherwise try and work with Gary  on pressing issues.  If there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679.

  George,  I can take a day off the week I get back from vacation.  Any day between  March 5th-9th would work but Friday or Thursday would be my preference.  Regarding the differences in the two estimates, I don't want to waste your  time explaining the differences if the 1st forecast was very rough.  The  items I listed moved dramatically.  Also, some of the questions were just  clarification of what was in a number.    Let's try and reach an agreement on the construction manager issue tomorrow  morning.    Phillip
  George,   The numbers on your fax don't agree to the first estimate that I am using.   Here are the two files I used.       Phillip

First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in the transaction.  2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC)  will be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer signing off on the deal.  3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as deferred profit has been acceptable.  Thanks,  Andrew Ozuna Real Estate Loan Officer 210-271-8386 ##   
  Attached  are two files that illustrate the following:  As prices rose, supply increased and demand decreased.  Now prices are  beginning to fall in response these market responses.

  John,  Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies  forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.  Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:  1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS,  TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the         parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and  TAGG but the issues facing         scheduling in Unify are grey.  2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the "assume it is messed up"  policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need  further      scrutiny.  3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical  imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?  4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training  courses, review progress and make cuts.  5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at  everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add     some value and direction to the group.   In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD  to work part time to get it done.  Phillip

  Jaques,  After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different  definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a  superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third  party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of "construction management"  fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be  paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally  the builders profit of 1.4 million.  Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out  of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if  they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?   We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition  to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been  in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and  the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management  fee is included.  George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will  review and let you know what I think.  The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to  the 3 out 4 approval process.  Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only  true costs + 1.4 million.  Phillip 
  George,  Please send the latest cost estimates when you get a chance this morning.  Phillip
  Jeanie,  Lavorato called me into his office to question me about my inquiries into  part time.  Nice confidentiality.  Since I have already gotten the grief, it  would be nice to get some useful information.  What did you find out about  part time, leave of absences, and sabbaticals?  My interest is for 2002.  Phillip

  Christy,   I read these points and they definitely need some touch up.  I don't  understand why we need to give our commentary on  why prices are so high in  California.

  Lucy,  Thanks for clearing up the 2/2 file.  Moving on to 2/9, here are some  questions:     #1 It looks like he just missed 1/26&2/9 of $110.  I can't tell if he still  owes $47 on his deposit.  #13 I show she missed rent on 1/26 and still owes $140.  #15 Try and follow up with Tomas about the $95.  Hopefully, he won't have a  bad reaction.  #20b Missed rent?  #26  Has she paid any deposit or rent?  #27 Missed rent?       
  Lee,  My fax number is 713-646-2391.  Please fax me a loan application that I can  pass on to the buyer.  Phillip Allen pallen@enron.com 713-853-7041
  Lucy,  Here is the 2/2 rentroll.  The total does not equal the bank deposit.  Your  earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.  But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to.  If the answer to  this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and  send it back.  Now I am going to work on a rentroll for this Friday.  I will probably send  you some questions about the 2/9 rentroll.  Let's get this stuff clean today.  Phillip
  no.  I am on msn messenger.

If they can really build this  many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously  it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard  to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is  subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the  El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

  Lucy,  Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject  to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.  It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there  unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.  When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize  that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.    Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes  if you need to.      Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and  refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form  to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this  information plus we need it for our records.  Something to look forward to.  It is 2 PM and I have to leave the office.  Please have my Dad call me with  the information about the units at home 713-463-8626.  He will know what I  mean.  Talk to you later,  Phillip

  Lucy,  Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.    There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.  1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank  is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the  spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.  2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?  3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?  4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?  5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?  6.  #14  missed on 2/2?  7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?  8.  #20a missed on 2/2?  9.  #35 missed on 2/2?  My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.   You may have sent me a message over the "chat" line that I don't remember on  some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the  bank deposit.  Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade  last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today.  I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.  Did you meet  them?  If so, what did you think?  Phillip
  I will email you an updated operating statement with Nov and Dec tomorrow  morning.  What did the seguin doctor think of the place.    How much could I get the stagecoach appraised for?  Do you still do  appraisals?  Could it be valued on an 11 or 12 cap?
  Jacques,  Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?    The key business points are:  1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate  2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million  3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.  4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?  5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.  With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a  solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes  costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I  would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax  all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the  checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing  but invoices were not being submitted.  Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some  tweaking.    Phillip Allen 713-853-7041 pallen@enron.com  
  Lucy,  Here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save.  My only questions are:  1.  Neil Moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on  12/01.  Even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the  beginning       of the two week period.  What is going on?  2.  Gilbert in #27-is he just late?    Here is a file for 12/08.

  Send it to Ina Rangel she can forward it to appropriate traders.  There are  too many to list individually
  Jeff,  My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a  sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only  require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I  would net around $20K cash.    You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or  higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the  New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.   Phillip
  Jeff,  I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4  years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several  reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the  large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer  are the three biggest concerns.    What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the  buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due  until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the  property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make  the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance  is pushing too far.  Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the  earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?  Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New  Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get  started on the list.  Email or call  me later today.  Phillip   
  Susan,  Raised your issue to Sally Beck.  Larry is going to spend time with you to  see if he can live without any reports.  Also some IT help should be on the  way.  Phillip

I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have  several people who have not left before 10:30 this week.  2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on  Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading  floor until after 5:00 p.m. 3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and  benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here  late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One  suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my  understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)  I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get  the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books  like this and not lose good people.

But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third consecutive day. The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market information. But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening. But that still wasn't enough juice. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of $250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the $250/MWh price cap. The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the market at prices 10 times higher. Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000 megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts - for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said. The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency, which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps. The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing. But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources. "In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation," Dorinson said. Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high-priced power. SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs. -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00 1318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc 13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay Pwr Plant (This article was originally published Wednesday) LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy Corp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif., Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said. The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday, 7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the ISO. The ISO manages grid reliability. As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling blackouts. The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE). Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.      -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00 1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc 13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 =DJ Calif Regulators Visit AES,Dynegy Off-Line Power Plants (This article was originally published Wednesday)     By Jessica Berthold    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons. The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so. As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE) said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday evening. Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES and Dynegy Tuesday evening. AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron Thomas said. Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives returned Wednesday for a full inspection.     AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits  The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed, Thomas said. AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos and Redondo Beach plants. The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company $20 million for polluting. "We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it," Thomas said. "It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality district's" authority. As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.     Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC  Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line Wednesday. "I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'" said Dynegy spokesman Lynn Lednicky. Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired. "We've been doing all we can to get back in service," Lednicky said. "We even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited." Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of why its units were off line. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872, jessica.berthold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00 1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc   G_nther A.

  Got your email.  I will let Jacques know.  I guess we can work out the finer  points next week.

  George,  The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted  to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could  not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more  towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One  wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3  kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage +  guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This  plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the  courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor  living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.   The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass  skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have  single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.    I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would  like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I  would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I  would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we  didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan.   Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.   pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work)   Phillip Allen   PS.  Channel 2 in Houston ran a story yesterday (Feb. 2) about a home in  Kingwood that had a poisonous strain of mold growing in the walls.  You  should try their website or call the station to get the full story.  It would  makes a good case for breathable walls.
  8500?????  That's twice as valuable as your car!  Can't you get a used one  for $3000?

  Testing.  Sell low and buy high ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/31/2001  04:51 PM ---------------------------     	 	 	From:  Phillip K Allen                           01/12/2001 08:58 AM 	  To: 8774820206@pagenetmessage.net cc:   Subject:   testing 
  Jeff,  Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.  1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and  repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor  cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on  repairs.  2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite  manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has  interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager  that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a  management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager  onsite.  3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you  want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.  4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure  this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.  My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property  definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.

Cash Needs Highlights: SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com= plete=20 cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20 program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation= s=20 and other measures.=20 Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20 available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51= .8=20 million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20 conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date. II. Credit Relationships Highlights: SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20 extend or renew credit as it has become due. At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE. SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau= lt.=20 Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a= nd=20 payable. SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond= =20 indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20 indebtedness if it were feasible to do so. Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of = its=20 rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade= =20 issues within the last three weeks. III. Energy Cost Scenarios Highlights This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20 various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=  such=20 scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001. IV. Cost Containment Initiatives Highlights SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001. The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital= =20 improvement component as follows (in millions): Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77 Capital Improvement Costs                383 Total                                             $ 460 The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to= =20 be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr= om=20 contract employees. Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the= =20 most part being deferred to a future date. SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20 executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20 savings of approximately $92 million. V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20 Activity) Highlights: As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20 Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20 includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20 million and accelerated revenues of $175 million. As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s= =20 Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion. Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th= e=20 end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit= =20 balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20 D.01-01-018. Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20 generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20 tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20 expressed in the TRA, are overstated. TURN Proposal As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU= RN=20 to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset= s.=20 Our comments are summarized as follows: The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i= t=20 would not directly generate nor use cash. The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh= ift=20 costs between two regulatory assets. TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=  the=20 revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection = in=20 the TRA is overstated. VI. Flow of Funds Analysis Highlights: In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a= =20 positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion. During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to= =20 its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion. Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its= =20 shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm= on=20 stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati= ve=20 and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes. [there is no Section VII] =20 VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500= =20 million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20 In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.= =20 This increase correlates to the increase in market prices for natural gas for the same period. A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20 www.cpuc.ca.gov. =20 Dan

  Jeff,  That is good news about Leander.    Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have  about $225K invested in the stagecoach,   it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.    I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee  and Jaques Craig can  work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a  second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%. Checkout this spreadsheet.      These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.    However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy  show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some  trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the  time and I don't trust  Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from  now on.    I will have the operating statements complete through December by this  Friday.    Phillip     
  ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/29/2001  12:14 PM --------------------------- To: <cbpres@austin.rr.com> cc:   Subject: Re: SM134    George,  Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders  profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.    Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract.    Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.   2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule  must be discussed and agreed upon.  Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626   Phillip

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially  complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with  the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would "retain" $106 million (of  what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who  switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the  QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December  (and maybe earlier).  PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the  Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get  some assurances of payment.   SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due  on 2/2/01.  For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's  purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements  (Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be  resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this  occurred today.  Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will  happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.   Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is  dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it.

  By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15  As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile  Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas  storage number.   The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the  forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a  supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights.   "Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward," said William Burson,  a trader. "It makes the market for natural gas."   But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas  Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the  storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the  numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than  reality.   "It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what  we are reporting," McGill said.   As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons --  and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing  fingers at Wall Street.   Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently  stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for  the rise in gas prices.   "It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated," Adik  told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly.   In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric  utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry.   Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame  for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their  customers and constituents from such price spikes.   Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take  precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price  insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas  prices before they soared.   "We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over," said Paul  Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy.   But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers.   "There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to  change," said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security  Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass.    Hot topic   Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In  many circles, little else is discussed.   The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is  facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the  previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as  well.   The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of  his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial  pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating.   "It's the talk of the town here," he said.   A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per  thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile  to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by  customers.   But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand  cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage  for winter.   There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November,  prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information  Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating  bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher.   But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country,  including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas  markets.   "It's all about the weather," said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis.   Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York  traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile  commodity in the world.    Setting the price   In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of  gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading  contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had  widespread influence over gas prices.   The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon  as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale  prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from  utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what  they pay for the gas they expect to use.   There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention  of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge  of natural gas.   But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to  know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all  futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to  their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money  in a short time.   As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less  than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10.  Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's  weekly storage numbers.   Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to  need in the winter.   Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than  average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in  hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.   Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be  sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the  concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.   Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage  numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the  association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage.   But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice  president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had  continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand.   "I was getting worried," he said.   Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer.  Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices  dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.    Just passing through   Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but  pass their fuel costs on to customers.   Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas  charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas  Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday.   Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last  month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could  be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve  energy.   Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to  save an average customer about $25 this winter.   Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an  extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not  guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.   Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left  customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether  they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel  costs.   On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public  Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to  perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices.   "Consumers are taking all the risk," Micheel said. "It's time to consider  some changes."

  Lucy,  The apartments that have new tenants since December 15th are:   1,2,8,12,13,16,20a,20b,25,32,38,39.  Are we running an apartment complex or a motel?  Please update all lease information on the 1/12 rentroll and email it to me  this afternoon.  Phillip
  Larry,  Do you want the loan and wire amount to be for exactly $1.1 million.  Phillip
  Thanks for representing Matt.  Phillip
  George,  Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders  profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.    Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract.    Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.   2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule  must be discussed and agreed upon.  Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626   Phillip    
  Lucy,  Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There  are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all  the cold weather.  You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.   This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.  I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We  also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need  to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write  something today.    Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start  collecting.  Phillip
  We do not understand our VAR.  Can you please get us all the detailed reports  and component VAR reports that you can produce?  The sooner the better.  Phillip
  Ted,  Andrea in the analysts pool asked me to fill out this request.  Can you help  expedite this process?   Phillip  
  Frank,  Did you receive the information about the San Marcos apartments.  I have left  several messages at your office to follow up.  You mentioned that your plate  was fairly full.  Are you too busy to look at this project?  As I mentioned I  would be interested in speaking to you as an advisor or at least a sounding  board for the key issues.    Please email or call.  Phillip Allen pallen@enron.com 713-853-7041
  Questions about 12/29 rentroll:   There were two deposits that were not labeled.  One for $150 and the other  for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13?   Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For  what periods?    What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!   That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money  and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first  asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like  leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the  apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly  inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has  been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.  I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so  I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this  right?  Has the deposit been made yet?    A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.  Phillip
  it is ok with me.

In attendance were Ken Lay,  the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.  spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his  ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next  week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.   Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on  my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff  Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our  proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation  based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that  we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing  communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to  go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what  the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more  work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He  talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail  level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the  benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he  would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power  (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented  solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix  the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also  included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed  interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a  goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities  to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate  analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues  including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.   He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas  purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding  some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously  under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming".   Some of these ideas would require legislative action. State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of  generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that  they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This  was a frequently recurring theme. Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers. Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California. State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation. Expand in-state gas production. Take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies. Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time. Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear  more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be  able to help out here). Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made  some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy  some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation  thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control  approach with generators. Securitize uncollected power purchase costs. To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's  thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --  not just the 5 one year strips. He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the  deal. He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the  forward contracting issues. Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.

Here they are plus the  excel file is a net worth statement.  If you have any trouble downloading or  printing these files let me know and I can fax them to you.   Let's talk  later today.  Phillip  P.S.  Please remember to get Jim Murnan the info. he needs.     
  Gentlemen,   I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure  and a mortgage broker for help with the financing.  Regarding the financing,  I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston.  I have  sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information  on you.  Can you please send it to him.  His contact information is:  phone  (713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net.   I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information.  I  hope to pull that together this afternoon.   I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document.  He  was positive about his experience overall.  He did not seem pleased with the  bookkeeping or information flow to the investor.  I think we should discuss  these procedures in advance.   Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur.  Phillip
  Jim,   I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I  described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in  San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a  couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like  to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not  require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to  structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has  been mentioned is to obtain a "forward commitment" in order to reduce the  equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this  nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to  permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be  important to banks.    I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer  email or fax his financial statement to you.   Let me know what else you need.  The land is scheduled to close mid January.   Phillip Allen
  Jeff,  Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I  have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out  tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility  connections?  Other rezoning costs?    What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I  owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this  property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes  once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him  grazing rights?  What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and  annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and  American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we  are pushing the process as fast as we can.  Phillip
  Steve,   I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If  you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.          As far as recommendations, here is a short list:   1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales  above monthly index without enough consideration of future        replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be  injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.                     This creates a shortage in later months.   2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet  demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.                         Specific questions should include:      1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order  to fill storage?    2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too  much gas from Socal's system.          I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their  own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than  their injection capablity, but injected far less.   3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short  term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                      LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating  rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market  and the       consumer has benefitted.     Call me if you need any more input.   Phillip
  Lucy,   Here is a rentroll for this week.  The one you sent for 11/24 looked good.   It seems like most people are paying on time.  Did you rent an efficiency to  the elderly woman on a fixed income?  Go ahead a use your judgement on the  rent prices for the vacant units.  If you need to lower the rent by $10 or  $20 to get things full, go ahead.   I will be out of the office on Thursday.  I will talk to you on Friday.  Phillip

Note that the construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.  Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.  It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.  I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are $1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3 bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.      - winmail.dat

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack=  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the=  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a=  deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic= ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc= us is reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic= ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o= nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double=  dip" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg= islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th= e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac= e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon= g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t= hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in = breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th= e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi= ll be very difficult.  The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat= e would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately = $8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this = concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful= l disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the = details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=  will support the bond issuance to go forward.  Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB = 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi= ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac= k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo= r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am= ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre= ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get = paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li= kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20 =20 According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic= ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in = the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 = of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ= icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=  to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo= rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind= ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. =20 Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount:=09$4.125 B Lenders:=09=09JP Morgan=09=09$2.5 B =09=09=09Lehman Brothers=09=09$1.0 B =09=09=09Bear Stearns=09=09$625 M Tax Exempt Portion:=09Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate:=09Taxable Rate=09=095.77% =09=09=09Tax-Exempt Rate=09=094.77% Current Projected=20 Blended IR:=09=095.38% Maturity Date:=09=09August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t= he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut= horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi= tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power = going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz= ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor = has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is = that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f= urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it = is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas= ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif= ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi= dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl= ier in the crisis. =20 SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T= he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the = governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au= gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t= o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s= igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi= s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat= es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank= ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20  The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is= suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s= tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th= en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st= ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p= assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=  bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=  the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

  Dave,  The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars  that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped  from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk  will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.     The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as  follows:  October 2000  $1,395,000 November 2000 $1,350,000 December 2000 $1,395,000 January 2001  $   669,600 February 2001  $   604,800 March 2001  $   669,600 April 2001  $   648,000 May 2001  $   669,600 June 2001  $   648,000 July 2001  $   669,600 August 2001  $   669,600 September 2001 $   648,000 October 2001  $   669,600 November 2001 $   648,000 December 2001 $   669,600  This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by  the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day  (Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA  Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.  Let me know if you disagree.  Phillip

  George,   The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other  investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background  information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.   Background Questions:    Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in  Creekside.   Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project  description, investors, business entity,    Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.   Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on  recent projects.    With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple  of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the  investors.     Preferable Investment Structure:   Developers guarantee note, not investors.   Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.   Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.           Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should  tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in  any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that  leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any  information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.  Sincerely,  Phillip Allen    
  Bob,   Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy  Gay was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment  to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM  to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.   If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this  time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti.   She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.   Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr.  specialist.  Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.  Let me know  what is an acceptable cash amount.  Phillip
  Andy,   Please assign a user name to Randy Gay.  Thank you,  Phillip
  Andy,   I spoke to John L. and he ok'd one of each new electronic system for the  west desk.  Are there any operational besides ICE and Dynegy?  If not, can  you have your assistant call me with id's and passwords.  Thank you,  Phillip
  ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 10/24/2000  01:29 PM ---------------------------   "George Richards" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 PM Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> To: "Phillip Allen" <pallen@enron.com> cc: "Larry Lewter" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, "Claudia L. Crocker"  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.  REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based reporting.  BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?"  Please expand.  INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating.  CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped.  PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested.  I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.  Sincerely,  George Richards President, Creekside Builders, LLC      - winmail.dat 
  Bob,   Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her  efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  Patti stepped up to fill the  gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.  Patti held together the scheduling  group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Patti  was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she  would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the  traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This information  has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size  of the west desk positions.    Please call to discuss cash award.  Phillip
  Richard,   Are you available at 5:30 ET today?  Phillip
  Jed,   I understand you have been contacted regarding a telephone interview to  discuss trading opportunities at  Enron.  I am sending you this message to  schedule the interview.  Please call or email me with a time that would be  convenient for you.  I look forward to speaking with you.  Phillip Allen West Gas Trading pallen@enron.com 713-853-7041
  Lucy,         Here are the actual utility bills versus the cap.  Did we collect  these overages?  Let's discuss further?  Remember these bills were paid in  July and August.  The usage dates are much earlier.  I have the bills but I  can get them to you if need be.  Philip
  Bob,   Any time tomorrow between 10 am and 1 pm would be good for looking at the  plans.  As far as the TV's, what do you need me to do?  Do we need plasma  screens or would regular monitors be just as good at a fraction of the cost.  Phillip
